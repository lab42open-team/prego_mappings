# PREGO Mapping

PREGO uses mapping scripts to map KEGG and Uniref50 ids to Gene Ontology Molecular Function ids.
These mapping are facilitated using the ID mapping files from [Uniprot FTP server](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/).
Scripts are written mostly with AWK because of the large size of the mapping files.
